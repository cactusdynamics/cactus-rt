// Trace events emitted by client instrumentation library (TRACE_EVENT macros),
// which describe activity on a track, such as a thread or asynchronous event
// track. The track is specified using separate TrackDescriptor messages and
// referred to via the track's UUID.
//
// A simple TrackEvent packet specifies a timestamp, category, name and type:
// ```protobuf
//   trace_packet {
//     timestamp: 1000
//     track_event {
//       categories: ["my_cat"]
//       name: "my_event"
//       type: TYPE_INSTANT
//      }
//    }
// ```
//
// To associate an event with a custom track (e.g. a thread), the track is
// defined in a separate packet and referred to from the TrackEvent by its UUID:
// ```protobuf
//   trace_packet {
//     track_descriptor {
//       track_uuid: 1234
//       name: "my_track"
//
//       // Optionally, associate the track with a thread.
//       thread_descriptor {
//         pid: 10
//         tid: 10
//         ..
//       }
//     }
//   }
// ```
//
// A pair of TYPE_SLICE_BEGIN and _END events form a slice on the track:
//
// ```protobuf
//   trace_packet {
//     timestamp: 1200
//     track_event {
//       track_uuid: 1234
//       categories: ["my_cat"]
//       name: "my_slice"
//       type: TYPE_SLICE_BEGIN
//     }
//   }
//   trace_packet {
//     timestamp: 1400
//     track_event {
//       track_uuid: 1234
//       type: TYPE_SLICE_END
//     }
//   }
// ```
// TrackEvents also support optimizations to reduce data repetition and encoded
// data size, e.g. through data interning (names, categories, ...) and delta
// encoding of timestamps/counters. For details, see the InternedData message.
// Further, default values for attributes of events on the same sequence (e.g.
// their default track association) can be emitted as part of a
// TrackEventDefaults message.
//
// Next reserved id: 13 (up to 15). Next id: 51.
